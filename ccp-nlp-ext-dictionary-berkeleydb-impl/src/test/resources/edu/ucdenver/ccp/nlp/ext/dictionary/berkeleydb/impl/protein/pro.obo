name: TGF-beta
def: "A TGFB-like cystine-knot cytokine whose propeptide region is a latent associated peptide (LAP) that remains associated to the mature TGF-beta after cleavage and secretion, keeping TGF-beta inactive. TGF-beta is the founding member of the cystine-knot cytokine family, and is related to the activin/inhibin, anti-Muellerian hormone, and bone morphogenic protein families, which are all involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation."
