Our study pool consisted of 323 POAG patients. Of these 116 were patients who had HTG with intraocular perssure (IOP) >21mmHg and 207 were found to be non-HTG patients (presenting IOP<21mmHg). The study also included 303 participants as controls. The polymorphisms were genotyped in both the patients and the controls using the PCR-RFLP method. Moreover, the SNP that showed significant association was validated by DNA sequencing. The haplotypes were obtained using Haploview 4.1 software. The allele and haplotype frequencies were compared between the patient group and the control group using Pearson's Ï‡(2) test.";
