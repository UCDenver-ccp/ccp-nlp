The Colorado Computational Pharmacology (CCP) type system is generic in nature. It is 
designed to be light-weight model capable of referencing types that are 
organized by external resources, e.g. ontologies.

The term "referent" is used in the above paper. Replacing "referent" with "mention" 
will allow most terms in the paper to be mapped directly to the CCP type system.
