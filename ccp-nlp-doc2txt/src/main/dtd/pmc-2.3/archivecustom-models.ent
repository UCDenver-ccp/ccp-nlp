      =============================================================
     Version 2.3                       (DAL/BTU) v2.3 (2007-02-02)
     
     Enhancement Release (2.3) following the Working Group meetings 
     of Oct-Nov/2006-Jan/2007. No backward-incompatible changes.
     Archiving loosened even more. New structures for all the DTDs. 
     
 40. TERM ELEMENTS - Added <chem-struct-wrapper> to the contents of 
     <term> using -%chem-struct-wrap.class; inside -%term-elements;
     so that you can use a <chem-struct-wrapper> anywhere you can use 
     a <disp-formula>.
     
 39. ARTICLE META MODEL - Used to require <fpage> or <lpage> even
     when there was a <page-range>. Now both are optional.
     
 38. Address models 
     - Added <label> to <address> through -%address-model;
     - Added <x> to <address> through -%address-model;
     
 37. PRODUCT
       - Added <size>  to <product> through -%product-elements;
       - Added <label> to <product> through -%product-elements; 
     
 36. ANONYMOUS - Over-rode anonymous-elements to add <x>
     
 35, PUB-DATE - Allowed <season> to be in the same <pub-date> with
     <day> and <month> instead of as an alternative to the day
     or month. Put <season> first in the model, since the only 
     examples seen that used both on one <pubdate> put the 
     season first and the order does not change the normal case.
     
 34. DUPLICATE PES - Moved 3 Parameter Entities into this module
     from because needed to use them in other over rides in this
     module. The two entities themselves are unchanged.
       - sec-opt-title-mod (from common.ent for app-model)
     
 33. APPENDIX TITLE - Made the appendix title optional by replacing
     "sec-model" with "sec-opt-title-model" in the parameter entity
     -%app-model;.
     
 32. ELEMENT <x> ELEMENTS - Added the elements <sub>, <sup>, and all 
     the emphasis elements to <x> through -%x.elements.
     
 31. ADDED <x> TO MODELS - Using x.class, added the element <x>
     to the following models:
      - address-model
      - conference-model (new to this module)
                                              
      - copyright-statement-elements
      - etal-elements (new to this module)
      - issue-title-elements
      - kwd-elements
      - label-elements
      - role-elements
      - title-elements
      - xref-elements
     
 30. CONTRIB GROUP MODEL - Eliminated all order in the model
     (contributors used to come first) and allowed <x> anywhere
     inside the model so that all text between elements can be 
     captured.
     
 29. RELATED ARTICLE ELEMENTS - Added <journal-id> to 
     <related-article> textual mixture (related-article-elements)
     using the new  journal-id.class.
     
 28. PRODUCT ELEMENTS - Added <label> to product textual mixture
     (product-elements) using label.class.
     
 27. ADDRESS MODEL
     a) Added <label> to address model using label.class.
     b) Added <x> to address model using x.class.
     
 26. PARAGRAPH ELEMENTS - Created new class "contract-grant"
     to hold old elements <contract-num> and <contract-sponsor>,
     as well as new elements <grant-num> and <grant-sponsor>.
     To be used (initially) as part of Paragraph elements
     (-%p-elements;)
     
 25. ARTICLE METADATA MODEL
      
     a) Added <grant-num>* and <grant-sponsor>* to the contents of 
        <article-meta>. This is a temporary insertion for 
        version 2.3. A more structured model for grant material 
        and sponsorship is expected to be introduced in version 3.0.
        
     b) Made it possible to have a <page-range> without requiring
        an <fpage> 
     
 24. SECTION MODEL - Brought into this module to require that
     both <label> and <title> be present made optional for Sections,
     Appendices, and similar elements. This less-than-optimal
     modeling allows for the case where the tagging had faked
     sections headings using bolded paragraphs. This change is made
     in full knowledge of the fact that these falsely headed
     sections will make autogeneration of Tables of Contents
     problematic.
     
 23. PERSON-GROUP-MODEL
     
     a. Added new PE "person-group-elements" to hold content of
        this PE
        
     b. Changed <person-group> to #PCDATA model from element content
        model that uses person-group-elements
        
     c. Changed person-group-elements from allowing
        (aff | name.class | etal) be replaced <etal> with the
        more generic "person-group-info" that will include <aff>,
       < etal>, and any similar information added  in the future.
     
 22. REF-MODEL
     
     a. Changed the construction but not the content of <ref>
        by changing -%ref-model from using the elements <citation> 
        and <note> directly to using the classes -%citation,class; 
        and -%note.class;.
        
     b. Added <x> to the content, using -%x.class; in the 
        -%ref-model PE
     
 21. NLM CITATION - Added <nlm-citation> as an alternative to
     unstructured <citation>s by adding <nlm-citation>
     to %citation.class;. This changed the models for:
      - <ref>, which uses %citation.class; inside %ref-model;
      - the inside cell mix (used for <td>, <th>, and 
          OASIS <entry>
      - <p> through -%p-elements;
  
 20. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.2                       (DAL/BTU) v2.2 (2006-04-30)
     
     Backwards-compatible changes to meet operational needs.
     Typical changes include adding attribute values and making 
     required elements optional.

 19. SIGNATURE BLOCK AND SIGNATURE - Added new overriding Parameter
     Entities -%sig-block-elements; for use in the <sig-block> model 
     and -%sig-elements; for use in the <sig> model.

 18. PRICE - New <price> element added to <product>.
  
 17. Updated public identifier to "v2.2 20060430//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.1                       (DAL/BTU) v2.1 (2005-06-30)
          
     Changed to MathML 2.0 and MathML 2.0 Character Sets
     Added new material requested by the online list     

          
 16. PERMISSIONS - Added a new <permissions> wrapper element to
     consolidate copyright and licensing information. For backwards
     compatibility, the new element will be added alongside the
     existing copyright elements. Best practice will be to use the
     new container, but <copyright-statement>, <copyright-year>,
     and <license> will be accepted in their old positions inside
     <article-meta>
      - Added <permissions> to <article-meta> model. This should
        be used in preference to the <copyright>, <copyright-year>,
        and <license> at the top level in the same model.
               
 15. Updated public identifier to "v2.1 20050630" 

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

 14. OTHER-TABLE-WRAP-ATTS - Moved this Parameter Entity to the
     display module, so all variant DTDs could use it.

 13. LOOSENING ALL PHRASE-LEVEL ELEMENT USAGE - As part of the
     version 2.0 split into 3 DTDs, removed the distinctions
     between where phrase-level elements may be used. Now, if
     you can use one phrase-level, you can use them all. This
     allows any in any order. Phrase-level elements include the
     address elements (which is only a little odd for <addr-line>).
     
     New Parameter Entity is %all-phrase; used inside:
      - the Parameter Entities named "nnn-elements" that can
        be mixed with #PCDATA in the content model of the nnn
        element (for which the defaults are defined in the module 
        that holds the element, just before the element, and the
        over-rides are defined below.)
      - And the following content model over-rides:
        . %chem-struct-model; (via %chem-struct-elements;)
        . %copyright-statement-model; (renamed -elements)
        . %history-model; (via %history-elements)

 12. ACCESS CLASS
        ### Customization Alert ###
     a. Took <ext-link> out of -%access.class;. It did not belong.
        It belongs in -%address-link.class;
     b. Added -%address-link.class; to anywhere regular
        %access.class; was used.

 11. ATTRIBUTE VALUE LISTS - The Green (Archival) DTD needed to
     change all explicit attribute value lists in the DTD to CDATA. 
     In the future, explicit list types will be a feature of the
     Blue (Publishing) and new Authoring DTDs. Therefore, added
     Parameter Entities to hold the following attributes:
       - %date-atts; (date-type changed from list to CDATA)
       - %article-id-atts; (pub-id-type changed to CDATA)
       - %pub-id-atts; (pub-id-type changed to CDATA)
       - %xref-atts; (ref-type changed to CDATA)
     
 10. <x> GENERATED TEXT AND PUNCTUATION ELEMENT:
     a. Added to the following models:
        - %def-list-model;
        - %def-item-model;
        - %article-meta-model;
        - %person-group-model;
     b. Added to %contrib-model; and %contrib-group-model; 
        (via %x.class;)  
        (Therefore added to <contributor> and
         <contributor-group>)
     c. Also added to the element groups for:
        - %aff-elements;
        - %citation-elements;
        - %collab-elements;
        - %corresp-elements;
        - %product-elements;
        - %publisher-loc-elements;
        - %related-article-elements;

  9. OVER-RIDE OF ARTICLE-META-MODEL - Added new elements
     a. <custom-meta-wrap> containing <custom-meta>
     b. <email>
     c. <issue-id>
     d. <issue-title> (for special title or theme)
     e. <page-range>
     f. <volume-id>
     g. <license> (for now, just a bucket into which to
        dump license-related material until the AIT Workgroup
        does more analysis)

  8. DATES
     a. Made a new Parameter Entity %string-date-elements; to
        hold all the elements that may be mixed with #PCDATA
        in a <string-date>
     b. Used %date-parts.class; and %x.class; in 
           new %string-date-elements;

  7. PRODUCT AND RELATED ARTICLE
     Added reference elements to both

  6. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
     the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now,
     as this is the most flexible system, allowing for
     #PCDATA, mixed, or element content. (This is in direct
     contrast to the "-element" suffixed models, which are
     designed to prohibit element content and permit only
     #PCDATA or mixed content.) Added parentheses to Parameter
     Entity and removed them from the Element Declaration.
     -  %article-meta-model; 
     -  %contrib-group-model;
     -  %contrib-model;
     -  %def-item-model;
     -  %def-list-model; 
     -  %kwd-group-model; 

  5. CITATION MODEL / COPYRIGHT STATEMENT MODEL
     ### Customization Alert ###
     -  Replaced the Parameter Entity %citation-model; with the
        OR list Parameter Entity %citation-elements; and used that
        within the content model of <citation>
     -  Similar Change for copyright-statement-elements

  4. DEF-ITEM LOOSENING
     a. Made <term> optional and repeatable so that incomplete
        <def-item>s can be captured. 
     b. Added <x> to:
        - <def-list> by way of -%def-list-model;
        - <def-item> by way of -%def-item-model;
 
  3. RENAMED CLASSES
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Not all classes ended in the ".class" suffix. Changed the 
     following to add the class suffix:
     - %display-back-matter.class; used in -%preformat-elements;
     - %address-elements; (renamed -%address.class;!) used in:
          - %aff-elements; 
          - %corresp-elements; 
          - %publisher-loc-elements;
     - %contrib-info.class; used in -%contrib-group-model;
     - %block-math.class; used in 
          - %named-content-elements; 
          - %term-elements;
     - %rest-of-para.class;
          Inside the content model for Paragraph <p>, was renamed 
          %p-elements;. The content model for Named Content 
          and the model for %p-elements; still use
          %rest-of-para.class;.

  2. INLINE PARAMETER MIXES
     ### Customization Alert ###
     INLINE FORMULA/DISPLAY FORMULA/PREFORMAT/RELATED ARTICLE - 
     Changed the "-element" Parameter Entities to use the 
     OR-bar-first mechanism:
        - Inline Formula - In the PE %inline-formula-elements;
          Changed the PE "%all-phrase;" to "| %all-phrase;"  (Since
          the OR bar following the #PCDATA in the content model 
          had been changed to match.) 
        - Display Formula (%disp-formula-elements; 
             %disp-formula-model;)
        - Preformat Elements (%preformat-elements; %preformat-model;)
        - Related Article (%related-article-elements;)

                        Design Note: There is a major overlap between
                        this parameter entity and the mix for elements
                        that are at the same level as a paragraph.
                        Inline elements appear only inside a 
                        paragraph, but block elements such as quotes 
                        and lists may appear either within a 
                        paragraph or at the same level as a 
                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a 
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material 
                        will have restricted such elements to only 
                        inside a paragraph, some incoming material 
                        will have restricted them to only outside a 
                        paragraph and some may allow them in both
                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
                        be in either or both.                      -->
